### Syntax

- Slides are delimited by "---"
- The title slide is assumed to be 1st
- If there's an h3 tag in the slide, it's stuck in the header

---

### Markdown

- Markdown is simple and we want to keep the presentation layer simple
- There's a Ruby parser for Markdown

---

### Ruby

- Ruby is widely available
- Ruby is fun to work with

---

### HTML5

- Not quite sure why HTML5 is necessary
- &lt;header&gt; and &lt;section&gt; tags
   
--- 

### CSS3

- Powers the awesome transitions
- Gives us the awesome table layout control

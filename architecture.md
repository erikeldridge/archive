Architectural patterns
======================

* Fail to zero: a service designed for throttling down to zero eg a web app that guarantees at least a static page
* ? help menu: the '?' key command launches help menu eg gmail github twitter
* Using tilde for home, ie '/~' instead of '/home'. See paper.li and linkedin
* splitting view and business logic enhances the reusability of both in different contexts

requires:
	- php5

usage: 
	- put file someplace where a process can run for an arbitrary amount of time.  Note: a personal machine, eg a laptop, may loggoff and quit the process if left unattended
	- set the $end var to a time and date the logging should end
	- run the bot from the command line using php as follows: "nice -n 15 nohup /usr/local/php5/bin/php bot.php > nohup.out &".  Nice will run the bot at low priority.  Nohup will allow the bot to run unattended even if the user logs off.  The '> nohup.out' part channels the bot's output to a file arbitrarily called nohup.out.  The trailing '&' launches the bot in the background.
	- Be sure to note process pid, as it won't show up in ps after we logout.  If we need to kill the bot, we'll have to reference it by pid.  
	- use "tail -f nohup.out" to monitor traffic thru bot
	- confirm the bot is in the chatroom by looking for it's nickname
	- send a message to the chatroom and confirm that the bot has created a 'log.txt' file and written the message in it.

known issues:
	- Only 128 bytes of data are read in at a time, truncating the data written to the log file.

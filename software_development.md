* Plug two keyboards into macbook pro for super easy pair programming
* Maintain wiki page for each proj and link to it in code comments
* Maintain run book for all services
* Establish code conventions to avoid style-related arguments
  * Strip trailing whitespace, which clutters diffs

  * module description in a readme file in the module directory
  * project description in a readme file in the project root

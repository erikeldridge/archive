h1. OpenID OAuth YQL YUI party

This project explores what an authentication/authorization flow using OpenID, OAuth, YQL, and YUI might look like if we were all just out to have a good time.  The project is best explored with some good tunes like those on "Friday Mixtape":http://fridaymixtape.com/.

h2. Usage

# Load index.html in a browser
# Click the "Log in with your Yahoo! ID" link
# Authenticate and authorize with Yahoo!
# Observe "loginSuccess" in index.html's console after successfully logging in

h2. Installation

# Upload start.xml, complete.xml, index.html, and relay.html to a server
# Create a new file called "SqliteStore.php" and copy the contents of http://gist.github.com/373491 into it
# Create a new file called "jsonkv.php" and copy the contents of http://gist.github.com/376323 into it
# Edit the URIs throughout to point to your domain instead of "example.com"
# Edit the OAuth consumer key in index.html to use your OAuth consumer key

h2. Components

h3. index.html

The index file serves as the base of functionality, the house in which the party occurs, if you will.  Index.html calls start.php in a popup to get the party started.  After start.php, start.xml, and return_to.html perform their roles, index.html passes the OpenID _assertion_ to complete.xml for verification.  If everything goes well, index.html fires the _party:success_ event.

h3. start.php

Start.php is essentially a wrapper for start.xml and redirects the user to the log-in URI generated by start.xml.  Start.php is only required because we need to redirect the user.

h3. start.xml

Start.xml performs several functions to prepare for logging in:
# It resolves the OAuth consumer key to a project description, and from that fetches the url to return to after authentication/authorization
# It checks to see if an association between the Relying Party (RP) and OpenID Provider (OP) has been established, and if not, creates one
# It normalizes the id passed in, and uses it to discover the OpenID authentication URI
a variety of preparatory operations:
# Once the URI has been determined, it constructs the log-in URI, and passes this back start.php 

h3. return_to.html

Return_to.html collects the _assertion_ returned by the OP, parses it, and returns it to index.html.  Return_to.html is intentionally light weight to minimize the amount of magic at this party.

h3. complete.xml

Complete.xml is a YQL table that verifies the OpenID _assertion_, validates the _nonce_, exchanges the pre-approved OAuth request token for an access token, stores that token, and returns success only if everything wraps up well.

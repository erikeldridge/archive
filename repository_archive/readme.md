Yahoo! MBITS activity

This material was originally presented at the CSU Monterey Bay [Monterey Bay Information Technology Summit (MBITS)](http://csumb.edu/site/x24935.xml).  The [event description](http://csumb.edu/site/x24935.xml) describes it as a "designed to expose students to careers in computing, and to raise awareness of the new undergraduate computer science degree at CSU Monterey Bay and the existing computing-related degree programs at Hartnell, Monterey Peninsula and Cabrillo colleges. It will also serve to educate teachers and counselors about the growing opportunities in the field."

Erik Eldridge from the [Yahoo! Developer Network](http://developer.yahoo.com) led a 45 minute introduction to web development based on the material in this project.  The [notes.html](http://github.com/erikeldridge/yahoo_mbits_activity/blob/master/notes.html) file outlines the activity.

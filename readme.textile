h2. Credit

* Inspired by Derek Gathright's talk on YQL.  He created this presentation-style, developed the HTML/CSS/JS, and defined the UI

---

h2. Syntax

* Slides are delimited by "- - -"
* The title slide is assumed to be 1st
* If there's an h3 tag in the slide, it's stuck in the header

---

h2. Organization

* template.html defines the presentation wrapper and provides template html for each slide
* slides.textile defines slide contents
* build.rb renders textile, parses the template html, and maps the textile to template
* the css directory contains css for preso display and syntax highlighting css
* the css directory contains js for preso control and syntax highlighting js

---

h2. Textile

* Textile balances minimalist syntax & expressibility (CSS/tag access)
* There's a full-featured Ruby parser for Textile (RedCloth)
* Allows embedded html/css/js

---

h2. Ruby

* Ruby is widely available
* Ruby is fun to work with

---

h2. HTML5

* Not quite sure why HTML5 is necessary
* &lt;header&gt; and &lt;section&gt; tags
   
---

h2. CSS3

* Powers the awesome transitions
* Gives us the awesome table layout control

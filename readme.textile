h3. Credit

* Inspired by "Derek Gathright's talk on YQL":http://drgath.github.com/talks/20100515_MusicHackday/.  He created this presentation-style, developed the HTML/CSS/JS, and defined the UI

h3. Syntax

* Slides are delimited by ".slide"
* The title slide is identified by ".intro"


h3. Organization

* main.html contains html required for basic functionality
* build.rb renders haml, parses the main html (& custom css/js) and maps the haml to main
* css/ contains css for preso display and syntax highlighting css
* js/ contains js for preso control and syntax highlighting js

h3. Ruby

* Ruby is widely available
* Ruby is fun to work with

h3. Haml

* Haml offers nice balance of minimalist syntax & expressibility (CSS/tag access, Textile/Markdown)
* Haml plays super-nice w/ Ruby
* Haml allows embedded JS for running script on slides

h3. HTML5

* Not quite sure why HTML5 is necessary
* &lt;header&gt; and &lt;section&gt; tags
   

h3. CSS3

* Powers the awesome transitions
* Gives us the awesome table layout control

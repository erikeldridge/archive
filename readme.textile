h1. OpenID OAuth YQL YUI party

This project explores what an authentication/authorization flow using OpenID, OAuth, YQL, and YUI might look like if we were all just out to have a good time.

h2. Flow

# On initial load, index.html will make a call to YQL to get the openid authentication URI using start.xml
# If an association has not yet been made, start.xml will create one
# After getting the URI from start.xml, index.html will launch a popup with it
# After the user logs in, the OP will redirect the browser to relay.html
# For now, index.html polls the popup for it's location.  When the popup redirects from the OP to relay.html, the location will become visible to index.html's javascript
# Once index.html has the location, which is the OP assertion, it will pass this assertion to complete.xml
# Complete.xml will check the signature on the assertion and return success if it's all good

h2. Usage

# Load index.html in a browser
# Click the "click" button

h2. Installation

# Upload start.xml, complete.xml, index.html, and relay.html to a server
# Create a new file called "SqliteStore.php" and copy the contents of http://gist.github.com/373491 into it
# Create a new file called "jsonkv.php" and copy the contents of http://gist.github.com/376323 into it
# Edit the URIs throughout to point to your domain instead of "example.com"
# Edit the OAuth consumer key in index.html to use your OAuth consumer key
